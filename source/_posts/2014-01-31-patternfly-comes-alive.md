PatternFly is a new community project launched by Red Hat to bring a better user experience to all IT users: developers, system admins, and business users alike. Familiarity and consistency are two important factors in driving ease of use.  Software is intuitive when it is familiar and when it honors existing user mental models, in other words, when it works like you expect it to.  Documenting standard UI patterns is a first step towards ensuring this consistency.  The patterns provide a standard blueprint for solving common user problems, and when applied consistently across applications, they alleviate the need for users to relearn common interactions.

As we launch PatternFly, we have a well developed widget library that will help developers implement a common look & feel between IT applications.  Visual consistency is just one step, but it has been shown that when applications look the same, we can start to present users with more familiar surroundings.  Behavioral consistency takes longer to accomplish as it addresses how things work.  We have just begun to document some of these core behavioral patterns and will work on more.

We invite all user experience professionals and those interested in the value of promoting standard UI patterns and practices to join us in the endeavor. There&#8217;s plenty of work to do. Start by joining the PatternFly mailing list to keep current with what&#8217;s happening with PatternFly and browse out website to see how you become involved and apply PatternFly to your projects.  We&#8217;d love to hear from you!
