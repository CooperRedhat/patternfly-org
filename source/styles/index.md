Visual design plays a key role in creating design commonality within, and between, web applications. This is an overview of the PatternFly visual design system. Employing the key elements of this design system ensures visual consistency among our web application user interfaces.

The overall visual style is best described as clean and contemporary. Visual elements have been distilled, and streamlined, to showcase the application content. Most enterprise IT products are rich in complexity, and for that reason the underlying user interface design is simplified and subdued. The simplified user interface delivers an overall presentation that is restful to the eyes and easy to use.

The current PatternFly visual styles were developed with consideration for users and technical requirements. They are brand neutral and can be easily adapted to suit your brand requirements. As part of this effort various solutions were explored and tested. 

## Component styling

Components are styled with a flatter, 2d design treatment. The flattened presentation allows the application content to be more visible, because there is less “visual noise” in the form of gradients and other stylistic embellishments.

Edges are sharp and squared-off. When elements have borders, or use other lines, they always appear thin and precise. To avoid an excess of lines dominating the screen, “white space” is used to visually define screen areas wherever possible.

Gradients and other dimensional styles are reserved for interactive elements, such as buttons and tabs. Screen areas that are not interactive are filled with solid color fills. Visual effects such as &#8220;graying out,&#8221; glows, fades, and transitions are used to draw the viewers attention to state changes. Used judiciously, visual effects guide the user through the user interface to enable the completion of a task.
