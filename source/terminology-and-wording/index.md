## Abbreviations {#abbreviations}

### General Rules

  * Use abbreviations that users are familiar with and write out uncommon abbreviations.
  * Do not write out units of measurement.
  * Use abbreviations consistently.

      Avoid using abbreviations like &#8220;sysadmin&#8221; and &#8220;SysAdmin;&#8221; these are too informal. &#8220;System&#8221; should be singular (i.e., not &#8220;systems administrator&#8221;), because it can include both a single system and multiple systems, similar to &#8220;database administrator&#8221; or &#8220;brain surgeon,&#8221; who work on more than one database and brain, respectively.Taken from Red Hat Corporate Style Guide.

## Acronyms {#acronyms}

### General Rules

  * Use acronyms that users are familiar with and write out uncommon acronyms
  * Use acronyms consistently.

## Capitalization {#capitalization}

### Headline style

For headline style, capitalize the first letter of every word except for articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or), and prepositions of three letters or fewer (of, on, by, in). There’s one exception: Any word that is the first word in the headline or the last word should be capitalized, regardless of its part of speech. For example, “Where to Install”

### Sentence style

For sentence style, capitalize the first letter of the first word and any proper nouns.  Use sentence style for blocks of text and as described in “Capitalization for Common Components.” For example, “Only show subscriptions that match this Subscription Asset Manager Organization.”

For other currencies, use the national currency symbol whenever possible (£1,500 = British pound; €1,500 = Euro, ¥1,500 = Japanese Yen, etc.).

      Hyphenation
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Hyphenate when needed for clarity. Words that begin with prefixes are usually not hyphenated.  Prefixes can include &#8220;multi,&#8221; &#8220;non,&#8221; &#8220;sub,&#8221; &#8220;co,&#8221; &#8220;semi,&#8221; &#8220;pre,&#8221; &#8220;re,&#8221; etc. <b><i>Exceptions:</i></b> <i>When not hyphenating makes it unclear.</i> <i>For example:</i> <i>He recovered his health. He re-covered the leaky roof. </i>(AP)You will usually hyphenate: 
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Complex adjectives (compound modifiers). This is when two adjectives work together to modify an object. The hyphen is used when the first adjective modifies the second adjective. <i>Examples:</i> cloud-based solutions, right-side paralysis, system-wide menu.  <b><i>Exception:</i></b><i> We never hyphenate &#8220;open source,&#8221; even when used as a complex adjective.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          When the prefix ends in a vowel and the word that follows begins with the same vowel. <i>Examples:</i> semi-independent, pre-emptive. <i>Exceptions</i>: cooperate, coordinate

## Truncation {#truncation}

#### Instances where text might need to be truncated:

  * Page titles that show object/host names
  * Table cells that contain long strings or lots of data and that have some method to view the full text
  * Others?

#### Whether to design for truncating strings at the beginning, end, or in the middle requires a bit of research.

  1. Does the product have a default truncation scheme? (For example, CloudForms, which has a default setting for how to truncate host names but also a user preference if users want to change it to suit their naming scheme.)  If yes, follow that scheme along with the guidelines here.
  2. If the product doesn&#8217;t have a default truncation choice, think about how the product&#8217;s users are apt to name objects &#8212; is it more likely that the unique part of the name will be at the beginning or end of the string?

### Guidelines:

  * Avoid abbreviations or truncated text in navigation items (first, second, and third levels of navigation in the masthead; left navigation).
  * In column headings, if there is not sufficient room for the full spelling or hyphenation of a word, abbreviate the text according to the English abbreviation rules [actually, should be according to our rules too].  Do not truncate text in column headings.
  * Indicate truncated text with an ellipsis (…).  If the text is part of a link, the ellipsis should be part of the link as well.
  * Leave no fewer than 4 characters when truncating text, and preferably leave enough characters to give a fair idea of what the string says.  For example, don&#8217;t truncate demo1.internal-el6.satellite to de&#8230;
  * Ensure that there is at least one method for the user to view the entire string.  Options include: tooltips (useful for less than 150 characters or so), expanding rows, overlays, others?
  * For UI text (as opposed to user-generated text), ensure that the truncation does not make an awkward word (i.e. &#8220;associate&#8221; truncating to &#8220;ass&#8230;&#8221;)
  * If possible, ensure that truncation does not happen after punctuation, because then it is difficult to differentiate which is the ellipsis and which is part of the name.  For example, don&#8217;t truncate demo1.internal-el6.satellite to demo1….
  * If a table column is resizable, the truncated text should adjust accordingly, and continue to follow the preceding guidelines.
