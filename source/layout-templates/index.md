The first critical step in creating your PatternFly application is to choose a template to hold your navigation and content. We have created several basic layouts that can be used as a place to start. The code for these are included in the PatternFly distribution available from [our GitHub site][1].

### Basic Layout

This is a simple, single column layout that can be used for building a variety of screen types.

[<img class="alignnone wp-image-2084 size-medium" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="{{ site.baseurl}}wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-04-11-at-11.35.24-AM-300x190.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-11 at 11.35.24 AM" width="300" height="190" />][2]


### Two-Column

A two-column layout is useful for most applications and includes global/persistent navigation at the top of the page and a left hand column for a local navigator (usually a static menu, a tree, or accordion menu). A variety of two column layouts are available for you to use and combine with other PatternFly components and patterns.

[<img class="alignnone wp-image-2086 size-medium" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="{{ site.baseurl}}wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-04-11-at-11.36.43-AM-300x190.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-11 at 11.36.43 AM" width="300" height="190" />][3]

### Dashboard

A layout with a right-hand sidebar that is appropriate for performance dashboards or similar screens that do not require local navigation.

[<img class="alignnone wp-image-2088 size-medium" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="{{ site.baseurl}}wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-04-11-at-11.36.08-AM-300x191.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-11 at 11.36.08 AM" width="300" height="191" />][4]
