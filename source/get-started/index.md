Users suffer when applications they use are beset by inconsistent interface behaviors and visual designs. Inconsistency makes products more difficult to learn and use by requiring users to relearn common interactions when moving from product to product or when migrating from competitive products. PatternFly addresses this problem by providing a set of consistent behavioral patterns and visual design elements that can be applied across enterprise IT applications.

## Using PatternFly on Your Project

This site is the primary repository for everything PatternFly. It includes: UI widget and pattern libraries, sample layouts, visual styles, and an associated [GitHub repository][1].

### [Layouts][2]

Layouts provide a starting point for constructing your application.  Here you will find several [examples and templates][3] that you can customize for your own use.  PatternFly layouts are constructed using the [Bootstrap grid system][4] to be responsive out of the box.

### [Patterns][5]

Interaction patterns address behavioral consistency.  You can find all currently supported patterns in the [PatternFly pattern library][6].  Each pattern includes a description of the recommended design layout, interactions, and supporting rationale.  Some patterns may be linked to interactive prototype pages where you can see an example of how the pattern should work.  The code for these prototype pages can be found within the PatternFly distribution on the [GitHub site][1].

Consider these patterns to be recipes for designing common interactions.  You should you them as a starting point for designing your activity and extend or customize, as needed.

### [Widgets][7]

Use of standard widgets and styling will ensure visual and behavioral consistency with other applications applying the PatternFly toolkit.  Our widget library is built on [Bootstrap 3][8] with some extensions and additions.  Users can download component and visual assets, along with live code examples from our [GitHub site][1] to integrate with your project.  If you are in need of a widget that you don&#8217;t find included as part of our standard library or want to integrate PatternFly styling with another framework, [contact us][9] for advice and design assistance.

### [Visual Styles][10]

Visit the Styles page for additional information about color palettes, fonts, and icons used in PatternFly.
