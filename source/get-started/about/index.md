PatternFly is a community project that promotes design commonality and improved user experience. Its offerings include
visual and behavioral patterns based on research and UX best practices that solve common design problems. Our design
process is iterative; the best ideas win until a new and better idea comes along. We value collaboration and meritocracy
and invite anyone to participate in our effort to improve user experience across IT products and applications.
