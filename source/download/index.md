## Download the PatternFly Framework

The PatternFly Framework includes reference HTML markup and CSS for widgets and selected patterns.  You can use this code directly in your project or as a starting point for your own implementation.  The framework is built on top of [Bootstrap 3][1] and is licensed [Apache 2.0][2].  The PatternFly framework is available through a GitHub repository. This includes most patterns and widgets, but not all. We are adding new content all of the time. If you would like to contribute to development of the framework or bug fixes see how in our GitHub.
