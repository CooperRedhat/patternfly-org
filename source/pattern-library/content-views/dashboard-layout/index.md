## Overview

This section provides guidance on laying out a dashboard page, and does not currently include editable dashboard requirements. When creating a dashboard layout, use the [12 column grid system][1].

The following are suggested visualizations and placement of common attributes of a dashboard:

  1. **Dashboard Title Panel** (optional): A panel may be placed at the top of the page, flush to the top/left/right with a white background. This space may be used to contain a dashboard title, refresh action or trend filter. Place the title left-aligned within this panel.
  2. **Background:** Use a grey background color (#f5f5f5) for the dashboard page.
  3. **Refresh Action** (optional): If the dashboard needs a Refresh action so that the user can manually refresh, place it on the right of the Dashboard Title Panel.
