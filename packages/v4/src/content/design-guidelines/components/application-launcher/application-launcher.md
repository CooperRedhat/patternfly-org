1. **Icon:** used to open and close the menu.
2. **Menu:** contains a list of links.

## Usage

Application launchers are usually found within the masthead of a UI. They are commonly used when you want to allow a user to launch multiple applications from a common location. Use the external link icon to indicate when a link opens a new window. You can also use icons in the list. For longer lists, you can optionally add the ability to search the list and favorite items.
