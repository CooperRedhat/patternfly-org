<div class="h2">Basic structure</div>

<div class="h3">Components</div>

<div class="h3">Layouts</div>
<p>Layouts are generic tools that allow you to structure and organize the content on your pages.</p>

<div class="h3">Demos</div>
<p>Demos use components and layouts in combination to show you how to build more complex structures and application views.</p>

<div class="h2">Design guidelines</div>

<div class="h3">Styles</div>
<p>Style guidelines define foundational elements of the design system, like color, typography, and spacing.</p>

<div class="h3">Usage and Behavior</div>
<p>Usage and behavior guidelines communicate standards and best practices for common design patterns like navigation, dashboards, or forms.</p>

<div class="h2">Additional tools</div>
<div class="h3">CSS Variables</div>
<p>You can customize PatternFly for your project using the CSS variable system, which enables you to change style elements like color across your project. The CSS variable system is a two-layer theming system where global variables inform component variables.</p>

<div class="h3">Global variables</div>
<p>Global variables define and enforce style elements (like global values for color, spacing, and font size) across the entire system.</p>

<div class="h3">Component variables</div>
<p>Component variables are used to define custom properties at the component level. Component variables are always defined by global variables.</p>

<div class="h3">Utilities</div>
<p>Utilities are a set of classes that enable you to further customize and modify elements in your project without having to write any custom CSS.</p>

<p>For example, you might use a utility class to add additional spacing between elements, align content in a layout, or even add a box shadow to an element.</p>

For example, our code is written like pf-c-alert
alert
