<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-3xl pf-u-mt-xl">Additional tools</h1>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-xl pf-u-mt-xl">CSS Variables</h1>
<p>You can customize PatternFly for your project using the CSS variable system, which enables you to change style elements like color across your project. The CSS variable system is a two-layer theming system where global variables inform component variables.</p>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-xl pf-u-mt-xl">Global variables</h1>
<p>Global variables define and enforce style elements (like global values for color, spacing, and font size) across the entire system.</p>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-xl pf-u-mt-xl">Component variables</h1>
<p>Component variables are used to define custom properties at the component level. Component variables are always defined by global variables.</p>

<h1 class="pf-c-title pf-m-xl pf-u-mt-xl">Utilities</h1>
<p>Utilities are a set of classes that enable you to further customize and modify elements in your project without having to write any custom CSS.</p>

<p>For example, you might use a utility class to add additional spacing between elements, align content in a layout, or even add a box shadow to an element.</p>

Flexibility
PatternFly 4 was built to be flexible and is scoped to work in tandem with other design systems. This means you’re able to use PatternFly 4 components alongside components from systems like Bootstrap, Material.io, or older versions of PatternFly.

For example, our code is written like pf-c-alert
alert
